## 🎭 AI Persona & Gamification (Engagement)
*Goal: Turn portfolio management into a narrative-driven experience.*

### 1. "Boss Battle" Debates
*   **Concept**: A challenge mode where users debate a specific legend (e.g., "Convince Munger to buy Bitcoin").
*   **AI Mechanic**: The AI acts as the legend, scoring the user's arguments on logic, facts, and alignment with the legend's philosophy.
*   **Reward**: Win to unlock that legend's "Golden Framework" badge or specific UI theme.
*   **Impact**: High Engagement / Vitality.

### 2. Visual "Wealth Tree"
*   **Concept**: Replace line charts with a living tree. Solid investments (quality/dividends) make it bloom; risky/loss positions make branches wither.
*   **AI Mechanic**: Generative visualization that evolves based on portfolio health metrics.
*   **Impact**: Emotional connection to long-term growth.

### 3. The "Boardroom" Mode (AR/VR Ready)
*   **Concept**: A view where the 5 legends sit around a virtual table. You place a stock card in the center, and they visually react and argue in real-time.
*   **AI Mechanic**: Multi-agent conversation system with distinct personalities interactively debating a specific ticker.
*   **Impact**: Premium "v0" visual wow factor.

### 4. "Roast My Portfolio"
*   **Concept**: A humor-mode analysis where legends ruthlessly critique bad picks (e.g., Burry mocking high P/E stocks or Lynch asking if you strictly understand the product).
*   **AI Mechanic**: Style-transfer generation focused on satire and sharp financial critique.
*   **Impact**: Viral sharing potential.

### 5. Legendary Level-Up System
*   **Concept**: Users start as a "Novice" and earn titles (e.g., "Value Apprentice") by actually adhering to principles (e.g., low turnover, high margin of safety) in their real trading.
*   **AI Mechanic**: Pattern recognition on user trade history to award style points.
*   **Impact**: Behavior modification/Gamification.

*   **Impact**: Real-time market pulse.

### 10. "Blind Taste Test"
*   **Concept**: The AI shows two company balance sheets/metrics without names. The user picks the better business, then the AI reveals the tickers (e.g., "You chose KO over PEP").
*   **AI Mechanic**: Data anonymization and comparative presentation.
*   **Impact**: Educational (focusing on fundamentals vs. hype).
